# Tasks 8-9: Budget Features - Implementation Plan
**Assigned to:** Qiao Huang

## Task 8: Monthly Budget Feature
### Description
Allow users to set monthly spending limits for expense categories.

### Implementation Approach
- Create budget entry form with category dropdown and amount input
- Database table: budgets (user_id, category, amount, period)
- Backend route to save budget data

### Dependencies
- Requires Task 2 (database schema) - Gerves
- Requires Task 1 (user authentication) - Gerves

## Task 9: Progress Bar Display
### Description
Visual display showing spending vs budget limits.

### Implementation Approach
- Query transaction totals by category
- Calculate percentage: (spent / budget) * 100
- Display progress bar with remaining amount
- Color coding based on usage level

### Dependencies
- Requires Tasks 3-7 (transaction data) - Gerves & Samantha
- Requires Task 8 (budget limits)

## Current Status
**Update (October 2): Foundation tasks (1-7) have been completed by team members. Database schema, user authentication, and transaction management are now in place.

Tasks 8-9 are scheduled for implementation during Iteration 2 (next week) as planned in our project timeline. Implementation will begin once Milestone 1.0 demonstration is complete.
