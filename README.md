2. Concept 
The personal finance tracker is an application that allows users to record daily financial transactions, 
categorize expenses, and visualize spending patterns. It provides a simple, user-friendly interface 
connected to an underlying database, enabling structured storage and retrieval of financial data. The app 
bridges the gap between raw data (transactions in a database) and meaningful insights (charts, 
summaries, budgets), making it easy for users to understand and control their finances.
